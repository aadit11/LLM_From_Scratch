# Transformer-Based Text Generation  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project implements a Transformer-based neural network from scratch to generate text. The model is inspired by the Transformer architecture introduced in the paper *"Attention is All You Need"*. The goal is to train a language model capable of generating coherent and meaningful text given a seed prompt.

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… **Custom Transformer Model** â€“ Implements multi-head self-attention, feed-forward layers, and positional encodings.  
âœ… **End-to-End Training** â€“ Preprocesses text data, tokenizes it, and trains the model efficiently.  
âœ… **Text Generation** â€“ Generates text based on a seed input using an autoregressive approach.  
âœ… **Modular Codebase** â€“ Well-structured directory with separate modules for model architecture, training, and inference.
