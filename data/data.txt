In the year 1327 of the Second Age, the great continent of Vathros was torn apart by war. The mighty Kingdom of Eldoria, ruled by the aging King Aldric IV, had long kept peace through diplomacy and steel. But when the king’s only son was assassinated in the halls of his own castle, chaos erupted. The assassin was never caught, but a dagger bearing the sigil of the neighboring Malverian Empire was found at the scene.

Fury spread through Eldoria like wildfire. King Aldric, grief-stricken yet resolute, called upon his banners. From the northern highlands to the southern coast, knights, soldiers, and mercenaries assembled under his banner. Across the border, the Malverian Emperor, Varros the Black, denied any involvement, claiming the dagger was planted to frame his empire. But Aldric did not listen.

The war began with the Siege of Blackmere, a fortress that stood between Eldoria and Malveria. The Eldorian army, 30,000 strong, battered its stone walls for weeks. Malverian defenders, outnumbered but disciplined, held firm until a cunning Eldorian captain, Ser Edric Langley, led a daring night assault through a hidden river passage. Blackmere fell, and the path to the Malverian heartland lay open.

Emperor Varros, an experienced commander, refused to cower. He summoned his legions from the eastern provinces, swelling his forces to 50,000. Rather than meeting Aldric in open battle, he ordered scorched-earth tactics, burning fields and poisoning wells to starve the invaders. Aldric’s army, slowed by hunger and exhaustion, reached the Plains of Darvon, where Varros made his stand.

The Battle of Darvon was the bloodiest conflict Vathros had ever seen. Eldoria’s heavy cavalry, clad in steel and gold, charged first, smashing into Malveria’s shield wall. For hours, the battlefield was a sea of blood and iron. Varros, leading from the front, cut through enemy ranks like a storm, his black armor earning him the title “The Reaper of Darvon.” But just as Malveria gained the upper hand, King Aldric unleashed his trump card—500 war elephants from the southern isles, a gift from distant allies.

The elephants crashed into the Malverian lines, breaking their formation. The tide turned. Emperor Varros, wounded, ordered a retreat, but his forces were routed. Eldoria had won, yet at a great cost—half its army lay dead, and King Aldric himself had been slain in the fray.

With both leaders lost, neither kingdom could claim true victory. The war dragged on for another year, neither side willing to surrender. It finally ended when Aldric’s daughter, Queen Elenara, and Varros’s son, Prince Kael, met in secret and forged a peace. The two swore a blood pact, vowing that never again would their peoples war.

Thus ended the War of the Shattered Crown, a conflict of pride, vengeance, and untold suffering. Yet even as peace reigned, whispers of betrayal lingered—who truly killed the Eldorian prince? Some say the answer died with King Aldric. Others believe the war was never meant to end.
